# Floating Point Arithmetic Unit

Decimal Floating Point arithmetic implemented in vhdl based on kog-stone adder, a parallel prefix form carry look-ahead adder. It supports operations on IEEE 794 single precision binary numbers.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
